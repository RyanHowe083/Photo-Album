# Photo-Album
Console application that displays photo ids and titles in an album. The photos are available in this online web service (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos).

This project relies on some outside libraries for a JSON Parser. Libraries found at http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-json/jackson-jsonparser.html

To run this console applicion change directory in the terminal the src folder
Once there, type java -jar albumConsolApp.jar

You will be asked for a input to display all albums with the album Id specified. (Note if a number is used that does not exist in the list it will not display
album info but instead a warning message).
